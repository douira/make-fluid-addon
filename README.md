# make-fluid-addon
A Simple shell script that generates a Blender add-on file

## Usage
Run `sh make_addon.sh` in a compatible environment. It will download and process all files in the directory where the script is located. (Run without the first line to disabled this behavior.) The folder that appears can be removed once the process is finished. The resulting zip file can be imported as a add-on in the Blender preferences.
